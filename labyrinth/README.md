# labyrinth

This is my solution to an assignment for Individual Programming Project course at the University of Warsaw (MIMUW).

### Description
The program finds the shortest path between two positions in a $k$â€“dimensional labyrinth. Positions of walls in the labyrinth may be specified in two ways. Errors like incorrect input or memory allocation failures are detected and handled.

### Usage
Compile with ```make all``` and then run ```labyrinth```.
