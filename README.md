This repository contains my solutions to assignments for Individual Programming Project course at the University of Warsaw (MIMUW).


## labyrinth

The program finds the shortest path between two positions in a $k$â€“dimensional labyrinth. Positions of walls in the labyrinth may be specified in two ways. Errors like incorrect input or memory allocation failures are detected and handled.


## phone-forward

This assignment was divided into three segments, and each segment introduced new requirements or modified existing ones. The code is fully documented using Doxygen.

It is a library that allows performing various operations on phone numbers, which are non-empty strings composed of digits '0' to '9' and characters '*', '#' representing the tenth and eleventh digits.
The library's key features include:
- Redirection of all numbers starting with a given prefix.
- Deletion of redirections.
- Finding the redirection of a given phone number.
- Finding all numbers redirected to a given phone number.
