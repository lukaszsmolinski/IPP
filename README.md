This repository contains my solutions to assignments for Individual Programming Project course at the University of Warsaw (MIMUW).


## labyrinth

The program finds the shortest path between two positions in a $k$â€“dimensional labyrinth. Positions of walls in the labyrinth may be specified in two ways. Errors like incorrect input or memory allocation failures are detected and handled.


## phone-forward

This assignment was divided into three segments, and each segment introduced new requirements or modified existing ones. The code was fully documented using Doxygen. Various data structures, such as trie and list, were implemented and utilized.

It is a library that allows performing various operations on phone numbers, which are non-empty strings (of arbitrary length) composed of digits '0' to '9' and characters '*', '#' representing the tenth and eleventh digits.
The library's key features include:
- Redirection of all numbers starting with a given prefix.
- Deletion of redirections.
- Finding the redirection of a given phone number.
- Finding all numbers redirected to a given phone number.
